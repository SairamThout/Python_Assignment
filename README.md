# My Python Task Solutions

Welcome to the repository for my Python tasks! This project contains solutions for two tasks: Task 1 and Task 2. The Python scripts `Task 1.py` and `Task 2.py` are provided for you to review and run.

## Overview

This repository includes the following files:

- `Task 1.py` – A Python script for Task 1.
- `Task 2.py` – A Python script for Task 2.
- `ideal.csv` – A CSV file used for data processing in the scripts.
- `mapped_test_data.csv` – A CSV file used for data mapping in the scripts.
- `test.csv` – A CSV file used for testing purposes in the scripts.
- `train.csv` – A CSV file used for training purposes in the scripts.

## Requirements

To run the Python scripts, you will need:

- Python 3.x (recommended version 3.7 or higher)
- Pandas library (for handling CSV files and data manipulation)

You can install the required library using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas




1.Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the Python scripts:

Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/SairamThout/Python_Assignment.git

2.Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the directory where the repository is cloned:

cd your-repository

3.Prepare the CSV Files

Make sure that the following CSV files are located in the same directory as the Python scripts:

ideal.csv
mapped_test_data.csv
test.csv
train.csv
These files are required for the scripts to run properly.

4.Run the Python Scripts

You can execute the Python scripts using the following commands:

python Task\ 1.py
python Task\ 2.py

Make sure you run these commands from the same directory where Task 1.py and Task 2.py are located.
